I'm excited to be moving to Bocconi University to continue my PhD study. Previously I studied at UCSB, Rutgers University. I'm interested in mathematical problems with motivation from Computational Complexity, Foundation of Cryptography, Learning Theory.

Currently I think about:

* Structural and Fourier properties of [DNFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form).
 
Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have interest in discussing.

I am one of those international students who are banned from entering the US to pursue academic study, more specifically, affected by the [proclamation 10043](https://www.nafsa.org/regulatory-information/proclamation-suspending-entry-chinese-students-and-researchers-connected-prc).
