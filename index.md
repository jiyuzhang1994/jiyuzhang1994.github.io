Hi! I am a PhD student in the Stat&CS program at Bocconi University, where I have the good fortune to have been advised by [Luca Trevisan](https://lucatrevisan.github.io/), and lately by [Alon Rosen](https://www.alonrosen.net/) and [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/).

I like mathematical questions motivated by the theory of computing, meaning that they are concerned with *algorithms*, *computational complexity theory*, and *computational pseudorandomness*.

Recently I have been thinking about questions related to the topics of

* spectral graph theory
* applications of the Sum-of-Squares algorithms
* average-case complexity of optimization/inference problems
