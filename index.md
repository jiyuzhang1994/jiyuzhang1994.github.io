Hi! I am a PhD student in the Stat&CS program at Bocconi University, where I have the good fortune to be advised by Prof. [Luca Trevisan](https://lucatrevisan.github.io/), lately by Prof. [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/) and Prof. [Alon Rosen](https://www.alonrosen.net/).  

I like interesting mathematical questions motivated by the theory of computing, which are usually tagged with Algorithms, Computational Complexity Theory, Pseudorandomness, Combinatorics.
