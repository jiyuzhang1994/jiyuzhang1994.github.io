title: About Me
---

I'm a second-year master student at Rutgers University. I have broad interest in theoretical computer science. Particular interest lies in **Computational Complexity**. Currently, I mainly study **Circuit Lower Bounds**. Centering on this topic, I also study techniques from other related topics and investigate their connections.(e.g. algorithm design, derandomization, communication protocols etc..).

I also find the following topics interesting and hope to explore them in the future --

**Cryptography**(Mostly foundational problems)  
**Randomness and Pseudorandomness**([link](http://www.math.ias.edu/~avi/BOOKS/Randomness_and_Pseudorandomness.pdf))  
**Quantum Computing**

I want to know more about the world/universe/nature. For example, which of the five [worlds](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.678.8930&rep=rep1&type=pdf) described by Impagliazzo do we live in? Computational Complexity has its own philosophical flavor(see [this](https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/philos.pdf)) and allows us to see and investigate our world through distinctive [lens](https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2014/lens-of-computation-workshop).
