Hi! I am a PhD student in the Stat&CS program at Bocconi University. I was advised by [Luca Trevisan](https://lucatrevisan.github.io/) until mid of 2024. Lately I have been co-advised by [Alon Rosen](https://www.alonrosen.net/) and [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/).

I am interested in the design and analysis of algorithms, and in understanding the inherent difficulty of fundamental computational problems.

In particular, recently I have been thinking about questions related to

* spectral graph theory and its application to clustering and graph partitioning algorithms.
* algorithm design via efficiently computable certificates (in the form of spectral or sum-of-squares proofs).
