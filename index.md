Hi! I am a PhD student in the Stat&CS program at Bocconi University, where I have the good fortune to be advised by [*Luca Trevisan*](https://lucatrevisan.github.io/).  

I like interesting mathematical problems with motivation from the theory of computing, which are usually tagged with Algorithms, Computational Complexity Theory, Pseudorandomness, Combinatorics.

I found inspiration from the following introductory chapters about being a mathematician:

## 10043

Since 2020, the [Proclamation 10043](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/06/04/2020-12217/suspension-of-entry-as-nonimmigrants-of-certain-students-and-researchers-from-the-peoples-republic) (still in effect) has been preventing Chinese students from obtaining visas to enter the US. This is nonsense but ill-intentioned for: 

1. there is no evidence showing the affected students are supported by the military or the rarely-heard "military-civil fusion strategy".
2.  the affected student are majoring in subjects having no potential military/economic impact. The governor apparently has a poor understanding of these scientific terms...

See also [Scott's post](https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=7028) for a relevant discussion.
