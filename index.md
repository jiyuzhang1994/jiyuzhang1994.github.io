Hi! I am a PhD student in the Stat&CS program at Bocconi University, where I had the good fortune to be advised by [Luca Trevisan](https://lucatrevisan.github.io/). Lately I'm also fortunate to have been co-advised by [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Alon Rosen](https://www.alonrosen.net/).  

I like interesting mathematical questions motivated by the theory of computing, which are usually tagged with Algorithms, Computational Complexity Theory, Pseudorandomness, Combinatorics.
