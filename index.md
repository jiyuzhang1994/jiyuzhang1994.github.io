I'll be moving to Bocconi University to continue my PhD study. Previously I studied at UCSB, Rutgers University. I'm interested in mathematical problems with motivation from Computational Complexity, Foundation of Cryptography, Learning Theory.

Currently I think about:

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have interest in discussing.
