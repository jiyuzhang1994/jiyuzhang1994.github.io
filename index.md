Hi! I am a PhD student in the Stat&CS program at Bocconi University, where I have the good fortune to be advised by [*Luca Trevisan*](https://lucatrevisan.github.io/). 

You can reach me at &nbsp;***jiyu dot zhang at phd dot unibocconi dot it***

## Research Interests


I like interesting mathematical problems with motivation from the theory of computing, which are usually tagged with Algorithms, Computational Complexity Theory, Pseudorandomness, Combinatorics.

I found inspiration from the following introductory chapters about being a mathematician:

[Thinking and communicating about mathematics](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~saks/300S/Part1.pdf)

## 10043

I am one of those international students who are (yes, still in effect) prevented from entering the US to join academic activities, mainly by revoking student visas. More specifically, this is due to the [Proclamation 10043](https://www.nafsa.org/regulatory-information/proclamation-suspending-entry-chinese-students-and-researchers-connected-prc). Besides its unclear definition of 'military-civil fusion strategy' and its misidentification of students in execution, I don't see any valid reasons behind this policy.
