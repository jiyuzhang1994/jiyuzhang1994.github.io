title: About Me
---

I'm a second-year master student at Rutgers University. I have broad interest in theoretical computer science.  
 
My current goal is to develop better deterministic simulating algorithm for randomized space-bounded computation. The related areas are called **Derandomization** and **Pseudorandomness**.

I'm also interested in working on **Cryptography** in the future.
