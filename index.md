title: About Me
---

I'm a second-year master student at Rutgers University. I have broad interest in theoretical computer science.  
 
My current goal is to develop better deterministic simulating algorithm for randomized space-bounded computation. The related areas are called **Derandomization** and **Pseudorandomness**.

I'm also interested in working on **Cryptography** in the future.

I come from [Anyue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyue_County) (known as [Puzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pu_Prefecture_(Sichuan)) in Song Dynasty), Sichuan. There might be a negligible probability that you know this place because of [Qin Jiushao](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Qin_Jiushao/) and his constructive proof of the [Chinese Remainder Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem).
