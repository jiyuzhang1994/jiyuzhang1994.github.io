Hi! I am a PhD student in the Stat&CS program at Bocconi University, where I have the good fortune to be advised by [*Luca Trevisan*](https://lucatrevisan.github.io/).  

I like interesting mathematical problems motivated by the theory of computing, which are usually tagged with Algorithms, Computational Complexity Theory, Pseudorandomness, Combinatorics.

## 10043

Since 2020, the [Proclamation 10043](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/06/04/2020-12217/suspension-of-entry-as-nonimmigrants-of-certain-students-and-researchers-from-the-peoples-republic) (still in effect) has been preventing Chinese students from obtaining visas to enter the US.

## Miscellaneous

I was inspired by this introductory chapter about being a mathematician: [Thinking and communicating about mathematics](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~saks/300S/Part1.pdf)  

I'm a typical post-90s grown up in China. I develop broad (some superficial) interests in things from different culture that attract me. I enjoyed the rich east Asian and the western cultural things, in the form of pop music, dramas, anime, video games, NBA, classics. Now I spend more time thinking about math. Recently, I'm into [Jay Chou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Chou)'s music (again).  

It's easy to find a topic to talk with me :). I keep an open mind to new things!
