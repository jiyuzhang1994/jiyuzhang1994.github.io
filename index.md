Previously I studied at UCSB, Rutgers University. I'm interested in mathematical problems (combinatorics and probability) with motivation from Computational Complexity, Foundation of Cryptography, Learning Theory.

Currently I think about:

* Structural and Fourier properties of [DNFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form).
 
Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have interest in discussing.
