Hi! I am a PhD student in the Stat&CS program at Bocconi University. I was advised by [Luca Trevisan](https://lucatrevisan.github.io/) until mid of 2024. Lately I have been co-advised by [Alon Rosen](https://www.alonrosen.net/) and [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/).

My research interests lie broadly in the design and analysis of algorithms, in computational complexity theory, and their interplay with related areas of mathematics.

Recently I have been thinking about questions related to

* spectral graph theory and its application to clustering and graph partitioning algorithms.
* algorithm and complexity for optimization and statistical inference problems

<span style="color: #FF0000;">I am looking for a postdoc position starting from September 2026</span>
