I'm excited to be moving to Bocconi University to continue my PhD study. I'm interested in interesting mathematical problems with motivation from computing.

Currently I mainly think about:

* Design and analysis of heuristic algorithms for average-case problems
* Analysis of Boolean functions. Especially structural and Fourier properties of [DNFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form).

I also have interest in applications of theory to understand practical problems.
 
Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have interest in discussing.

I especially like the the following introductory chapters about being a mathematician:

I am one of those international students who are banned from entering the US to pursue academic study, more specifically, affected by the [proclamation 10043](https://www.nafsa.org/regulatory-information/proclamation-suspending-entry-chinese-students-and-researchers-connected-prc).
