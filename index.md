title: About Me
---

I'm a second-year master student at Rutgers University. I have broad interest in theoretical computer science. In particular, I'm interested in **Computational Complexity**.

I also find the following topics interesting and hope to explore them in the future --

**Cryptography**  
**Randomness in Computation, Pseudorandomness** ([link](http://www.math.ias.edu/~avi/BOOKS/Randomness_and_Pseudorandomness.pdf))  

Five [worlds](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.678.8930&rep=rep1&type=pdf) by Impagliazzo.  
Computational Complexity and [Philosophy](https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/philos.pdf)   
[Lens](https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2014/lens-of-computation-workshop) of Computation on the Sciences.
