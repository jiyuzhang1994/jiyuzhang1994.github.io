Hi! I am a PhD student in the Stat&CS program at Bocconi University, where I have the good fortune to be advised by [*Luca Trevisan*](https://lucatrevisan.github.io/).  

I like interesting mathematical problems motivated by the theory of computing, which are usually tagged with Algorithms, Computational Complexity Theory, Pseudorandomness, Combinatorics.
