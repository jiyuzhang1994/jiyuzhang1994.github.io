I am a PhD student in the Stat&CS program at Bocconi University. Previously I studied at UCSB and Rutgers University, I'm grateful to all the professors who taught and helped me there.

## Academic Interests


I like interesting mathematical problems with motivation from computation.

Currently I mainly think about:

* Design and analysis of heuristic algorithms for average-case problems.
* Analysis of Boolean functions. Especially structural and Fourier properties of concrete computational models, like [DNFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form).

I also have a growing interest in projects that aim at closing the gap between theory and practice, especially in understanding experimental results on real instances, and in developing good heuristics guided by theory.
 
Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have interest in discussing.

I especially like the the following introductory chapters about being a mathematician:
