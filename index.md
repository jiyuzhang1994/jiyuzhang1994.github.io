Hi! I am a PhD student in the Stat&CS program at Bocconi University, where I had the good fortune to be advised by [Luca Trevisan](https://lucatrevisan.github.io/). Lately I'm also fortunate to have been co-advised by [Alon Rosen](https://www.alonrosen.net/) and [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/).

I like interesting mathematical questions motivated by the theory of computing, meaning that they're related to algorithms, computational complexity theory, complexity-theoretic understanding of randomness.

Recently I have been thinking about questions related to

* spectral graph theory
* applications of the Sum-of-Squares algorithms
