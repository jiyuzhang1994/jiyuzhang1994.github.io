I'm excited to be moving to Bocconi University to continue my PhD study. I like interesting mathematical problems with motivation from computation.

Currently I mainly think about:

* Design and analysis of heuristic algorithms for average-case problems, especially using spectral methods.
* Analysis of Boolean functions. Especially structural and Fourier properties of concrete models, like [DNFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form).

I also have interest in interactions between CS theory and practical problems, especially in understanding experimental results on real instances, and in developing good algorithms guided by theory.
 
Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have interest in discussing.

I especially like the the following introductory chapters about being a mathematician:

I am one of those international students who are prevented from entering the US (by cancelling student visas) to join academic activities, more specifically, due to the [proclamation 10043](https://www.nafsa.org/regulatory-information/proclamation-suspending-entry-chinese-students-and-researchers-connected-prc). I don't see any valid reasons behind this policy.
