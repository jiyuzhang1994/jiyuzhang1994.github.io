As Chinese it's already annoying enough to obtain a visa to enter any western country, however when the Italian embassy gets involved, things become exponentially harder.

Italian wants to be decent, everything needs to be formally addressed. One problem: even the office staff don't understand the business.

My family wants to visit me in the summer. To help my family to get a visa, I need to obtain a certificate of relationship for them. 

Problem 1: even this certificate is not clearly defined, you cannot find any format of this certificate on the website.

Problem 2: they do not specify who would authorize the document.

So I went to the Chinese embassy in Milan to obtain a certificate, which was reasonable because all my documents are in Chinese so they can recognize and verify. After weeks of effort, finally my family received the certificate and submitted it to the Italian embassy, and they said: we cannot acknowledge your document (because we don't trust the Chinese embassy), we need an authorization from the Italian side.

Va bene, now you ask them: WHERE in Italy should I go to obtain the authorization. They respond: we don't know, but our boss explicitly required that.

Finally,

Problem 4: when I went to the comune di Milano and the Prefettura, apparently they don't know what the Italian embassy staff is talking about...
