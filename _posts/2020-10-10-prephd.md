Draft


Transition from study to research.

On reading papers. 

Reading paper is hard, at least in my stage.  I feel it's better to do research-oriented reading, comparing to reading broadly. I'm imaginging the following process:  

Having a research goal ---> Pick relevant papers ---> Understand their main results, treat them as black-boxes ---> Propose some ideas ---> Check details.  

However I believe doing research is an integrated process combining studying tehniques and thinking abstractly, this is what I hope to achieve.

Different people read papers in different levels. I feel there are three levels of reading papers.

(a) understand what the main theorem says, and be able to use it confidently. 

(b) look at the main idea of the proof at a high level, and have high confidence in its correctness.

(c) zooming up technical details.

I think a skilled mathematician/researcher may be able to change freely among these three levels, and I hope I can make it as I study further.
