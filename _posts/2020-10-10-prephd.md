Draft


On reading papers. Different people read papers in different levels. I feel there are three levels of reading papers.

(a) understand what the main theorem says, and be able to use it confidently. 

(b) look at the main idea of the proof at a high level, and have high confidence in it.

(c) zooming up technical details.

I think a skilled mathematician/researcher may be able to change freely among these three levels, and I hope I can do it as I study further.
