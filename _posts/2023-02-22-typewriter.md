I wondered if the store owner just thinks it's cool to relate typewriters to Turing machines. However, in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) it writes:

"... Turing had a lifelong interest in machines: "Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; [his mother] Mrs. Turing had a typewriter; and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter 'mechanical'" (Hodges p. 96). While at Princeton pursuing his PhD, Turing built a Boolean-logic multiplier ..."

Maybe Turing did had some inspiration from typewriters.
