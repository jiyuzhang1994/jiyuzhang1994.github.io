## <a name="robp"></a> 1. ROBP and Matrix Multiplication

In this post we present Nisan's pseudorandom generator (PRG). In the next post, we will see how Saks and Zhou use this PRG to prove that $BPL\subseteq L^{3/2}$.  

Recall that we are interested in the ROBP where each layer of it has the same set of nodes, and the set is of size $2^s$. Each node in a layer has $2^m$ out edges each labeled with a string of length $m$ and maps to a node in the next layer. We can visualize the computing process as following:  we associate the transition from the $i$th layer to the $j$th layer with a transition matrix $M$ which is substochastic. So after $r$ times transition the resulting matrix is $M^r$. The entry $M^r_{i, j}$ is the probability that the ROBP starts at node $i$ and ends at node $j$ after $r$ transitions. The randomness is taken over the possible input to this ROBP.  

With this in mind we now present some techniques we need in order to analyze Nisan's PRG (which we will present later).  

## 2. <a name="tech"></a> Techniques  

**Definition 2.1** (Matrix Norm) Let $M$ be a $2^s \times 2^s$ matrix, we use the matrix norm $$\lvert \lvert M\rvert \rvert$$ which is the largest row sum of $M$:  

$$\lvert \lvert M\rvert \rvert = \max_{i} \sum_j \lvert M_{i, j} \rvert$$  

The following are some standard facts:

**Proposition 2.2**  

$$ \lvert \lvert M+N\rvert \rvert \leq \lvert \lvert M\rvert \rvert  + \lvert \lvert N\rvert \rvert$$  

$$ \lvert \lvert MN\rvert \rvert \leq \lvert \lvert M\rvert \rvert  \cdot  \lvert \lvert N\rvert \rvert$$  


**Definition 2.3** (Pairwise Independent Hashing Family) We call a family of hashing functions $H$ is pairwise independent if for any $x_1, x_2 \in A$ and $x_1 \neq x_2$, $y_1, y_2\in B$  

$$\Pr_{h\in H}\left [\ h(x_1) = y_1 \land h(x_2) = y_2 \right ] = \frac{1}{\lvert B\rvert ^2}$$

**Definition 2.4** Let $A, B\subseteq \{0,1\}^m$, $h:\{0,1\}^m \rightarrow \{0,1\}^m$. We say a hash function is *$\epsilon$-independent for $A$, $B$* if   

$$ \left \lvert \Pr_x \left[ x\in A \land h(x)\in B \right] - \frac{\lvert A\rvert \lvert B \rvert}{2^{2m}} \right \rvert \leq \epsilon$$

From now on we denote $\frac{\lvert A\rvert}{2^m}$ as $\alpha$ and $\frac{\lvert B\rvert}{2^m}$ as $\beta$.  

We now prove a mixing lemma which roughtly says that functions from pairwise independent hashing family are almost all $\epsilon$-independent.
