* [An Algorithm for Estimating Success Probability](#algo)



## <a name="algo"></a> 1. An Algorithm for Estimating Success Probability 

To derandomize $BPL$, it's enough to show a deterministic algorithm to estimate the $(i, j)$-th entry in the matrix $M^r$. Nisan's pseudorandom generator implicitly gives an algorithm for this purpose, we now present this algorithm and examine its properties.
