* [An Algorithm for Estimating Success Probability via Nisan's PRG](#algo)

Given a ROBP of our interest, there is a trivial algorithm to compute the $(i,j)$-th entry of one layer's transition matrix $M$: for input $(i,j)$, simply enumerates all transition strings $$\{0,1\}^m$$ and counts the number of strings that leads to $j$, then divide this number by $2^m$. This algorithm uses space $O(d+m)$.  

To derandomize $BPL$, it's enough to show a deterministic algorithm runs in small space and estimates the $(i, j)$-th  entry with error $1/d$ in the matrix $M^{2^r}$. We say this algorithm approximates $M^{2^r}$. 

For reasons above, from now on we phrase everything in terms of matrix exponentiation.  

**Fact.** The repeated squaring algorithm computes exact $M^{2^r}$ with space $O(rd)$.  

From Nisan's generator, we should see that it implicitly gives an algorithm for approximating matrix exponentiation. Let's show the algorithm below.


## <a name="algo"></a> 1. An Algorithm for Approximating Matrix Exponentiation via Nisan's PRG 

The algorithm starts by randomly picking a set of hash functions and store these functions, we call the space we need for this purpose the *random bit complexity*.  It then starts to feed the pseudorandom bits produced by computing these hash functions blockwisely to the ROBP and computes using the trivial counting algorithm. We call the space for this purpose the *processing space complexity*.
