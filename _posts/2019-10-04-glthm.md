In this blog we study and present the proof of Goldreich-Levin theorem. The main material we use is the  course notes of Prof. Luca Trevisan (See references below).  

The Goldreich-Levin Theorem has several interpretations. We will first explain and prove it from cryptographic view. Then we will see in fact it can also be viewed as list-decoding of Hadamard code.

## Background
In this section we present necessary definitions and math inequalities we will be using.

**Definition 1 (Hard-Core Predicate)** A boolean function $P: \{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ is $(t, \epsilon)$ - hard core for a permutation $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ if for every algorithm $A$ of complexity $t$  

$$Pr_{x\sim \{0, 1\}}[A(f(x)) = P(x)]\leq \frac{1}{2}+\epsilon$$


## Goldreich Levin Theorem

The Goldreich-Levin theorem says that a random XOR is hard-core for every one-way permutation. We denote inner product modulo 2 using the following notation:  

$$\langle x,r\rangle = \sum_i x_i\cdot r_i\ mod\ 2$$

**Theorem 1 (Goldreich-Levin Theorem)** Suppose $A$ is an algorithm of complexity $t$ such that  

$$Pr_{x, r} [A(f(x),r)\ =\ \langle x ,r\rangle] \geq \frac{1}{2} + \epsilon$$  

Then there is an algorithm $A^\prime$ of complexity at most $O(t\epsilon^{-2}n^{O(1)})$ such that 

$$Pr_x[A^\prime(f(x)) = x] \geq \Omega(\epsilon)$$

We will first prove a weak version of Goldreich-Levin Theorem, which will later be used in our proof of GL theorem.

**Theorem 2 (Goldreich-Levin Theorem Weak Version)** Suppose there is a function $H$ such that, for some $x$  

$$Pr_r[H(r)\ =\ \langle x,r\rangle]\ \geq \frac{3}{4} + \epsilon$$

Then there is an algorithm $GLW$ that can output $x$ exactly.  

Let's first see how an easy algorithm can find $x$ when the probability on the right side is 1 in the above (so that $H(r)$ outputs $\langle x,r\rangle$ correctly).  

Let $e_i$ denote the vector in which the $i$th bit is 1 and 0 otherwise. $x_i = H(e_i) = \langle x, e_i \rangle$. Then we can output $x$ by enumerating all the $e_i$.   

Now to prove Theorem 2, we use the majority vote method. Intuitively,  we randomly sample several points $r_1 \ldots r_k$. Let $H^\prime_{r_1 \ldots r_k}$ be the function that take the majority of  $H(r_i+e_i) - H(r_i)$ on these $r_i$s. The observation is that if $H(r)$ computes $\langle x, r\rangle$ correctly, then we have:

$$ \langle x, r_i+e_i \rangle - \langle x, r_i \rangle = \langle x, e_i\rangle$$

We now bound the probability that $H(r_i + e_i) - H(r_i)$ fails.  

$$\begin{align*}
  Pr[H(r_i + e_i) - H(r_i) \neq  \langle x, e_i\rangle] &= Pr[H(r_i + e_i) \neq \langle x, r_i+e_i \rangle\ \cup H(r_i) \neq \langle x, r_i \rangle]\\
  &\leq Pr[H(r_i + e_i) \neq \langle x, r_i+e_i \rangle]\ + Pr[H(r_i) \neq \langle x, r_i \rangle]\\
  &\leq \frac{1}{4} - \epsilon + \frac{1}{4} - \epsilon\\
  &\leq \frac{1}{2} - 2\epsilon
 \end{align*}$$
