I'm reposting this to clearify questions I had when study these notes.



There are two properties that Interactive Proofs must satisfy. Informally, a good interactive proof system for a language $L$ consists of a pair of prover and verifier $(P, V)$ that satisfies the following:

1. if $x\in L$, then there is a very large probability that $V$ accepts. (the **completeness**)  
2. if $x\not\in L$, then a malicious prover has very tiny chance to convince $V$ that $x\in L$. ( the **soundness**)  

Things to note: 1. the prover is usually assumed to have unbounded computational power. 2. a malicious prover (say Alice) means that she can make changes by herself and doesn't necessarily follow the protocol.
