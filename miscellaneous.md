more about me:

I'm a typical post-90s grew up in China. I enjoy pop music, dramas, animes, literatures, video games. I might consider to post about them in the future :) Recently I'm into [Jay Chou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L229QDxDakU)'s music (again) . More recently, [Fish Leong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FiQV1-z06Q).
