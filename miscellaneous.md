more about me:

I'm a typical post-90s grown up in China. I enjoy pop music, dramas, animes, literatures, video games. I might consider to post about them in the future :) Recently I'm into [Jay Chou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Chou)'s music (again) . More recently, [Fish Leong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_Leong).
