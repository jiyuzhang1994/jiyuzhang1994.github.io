I like (and was inspired by) this article about being a mathematician: [Thinking and communicating about mathematics](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~saks/300S/Part1.pdf) 

I'm a typical post-90s grown up in China. I enjoy pop music, dramas, animes, classics, video games, NBA. I might consider to post about them in the future :) Recently I'm into [Jay Chou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Chou)'s music (again)
