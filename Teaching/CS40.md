## <a name="proofs"></a> Logic and Proofs.


propositions(or statements/definite assertions), predicates(or indefinite assertions);  
quantifiers, universal/existential assertions;  
composite propositions, negation, conjunction, disjunction, inclusive/exclusive or;
implication, contrapositive, inverse, converse;
logical equivalence, use of de Morgan Law, how to remove parentheses, truth table;  
tautology, contradiction.  

proof strategies: direct proof, proof by contradiction, proof by contraposition; specific: proof by cases, existance proof, uniqueness proof.



Examples:  
"This statement is not true", neither true or false.  


Tips:  
try to explain, convince yourself.  
try to come up with/use examples to test your understanding.  
be patient, be careful, be curious.

Suggested reading material for mathematical reasoning: [Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~saks/300S/) by Prof. Michael Saks. Choose whichever parts you feel attracted to start reading.
