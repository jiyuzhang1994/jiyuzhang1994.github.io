The current goal of writings in this section is to (1) help understand definitions; (2) get familiar with main results; (3) study/practice classical proof techniques; (4) practice writing mathematical proofs.

1. For reason (3), I often write proofs on my own, therefore proofs don't necessarily follow the proofs in the original references. 
2. Since these notes are written discretely, there might be some notational issues in each part, i.e. different notations are used. I'll unify them later.  
3. For reason (2), some familiar proofs are omitted but I'll give references.
