### Cryptography   

These notes are written with a (probably) ultimate goal to be a self-contained notes. The current goal is to (1) help understand definitions. (2) get familiar with main results (3) study/practice classical proof techniques. 

1. For reason (3), I often write proofs on my own, therefore proofs don't necessarily follow the proofs in the original references. 
2. Since these notes are written discretely, there might be some notational issues in each part, i.e. different notations are used. I'll unify them later.  
3. For reason (2), some familiar proofs are omitted but I'll give references.
