I grew up in [Anyue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyue_County) (known as [Puzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pu_Prefecture_(Sichuan)) in Song Dynasty), Sichuan. Here there was a mathematician named [Qin Jiushao](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Qin_Jiushao/) who gave the first constructive proof of the [Chinese Remainder Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem).
