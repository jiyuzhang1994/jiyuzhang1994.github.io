I"?<p>I’m a second-year master student at Rutgers University. I have broad interest in theoretical computer science.</p>

<p>My current goal is to develop better deterministic simulating algorithm for randomized space-bounded computation. The related areas are called <strong>Derandomization</strong> and <strong>Pseudorandomness</strong>.</p>

<p>I’m also interested in working on <strong>Cryptography</strong> in the future.</p>
