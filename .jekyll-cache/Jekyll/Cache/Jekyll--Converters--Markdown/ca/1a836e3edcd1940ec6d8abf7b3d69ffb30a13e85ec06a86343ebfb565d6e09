<p>These notes are written with a (probably) ultimate goal to be a self-contained notes. The current goal is to (1) help understand definitions. (2) get familiar with main results (3) study/practice classical proof techniques.</p>

<ol>
  <li>For reason (3), I often write proofs on my own, therefore proofs don’t necessarily follow the proofs in the original references.</li>
  <li>Since these notes are written discretely, there might be some notational issues in each part, i.e. different notations are used. I’ll unify them later.</li>
  <li>For reason (2), some familiar proofs are omitted but I’ll give references.</li>
