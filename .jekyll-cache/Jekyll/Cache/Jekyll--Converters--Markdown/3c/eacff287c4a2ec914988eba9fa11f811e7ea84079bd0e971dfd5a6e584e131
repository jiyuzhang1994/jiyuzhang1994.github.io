I"õ<p>Iâ€™m excited to be moving to Bocconi University to continue my PhD study. Previously I studied at UCSB and Rutgers University, many thanks to all the professors who taught and helped me there.</p>

<p>You can reach me at <strong>jiyu dot zhang at phd dot unibocconi dot it</strong></p>

<p>I like interesting mathematical problems with motivation from computation.</p>

<p>Currently I mainly think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design and analysis of heuristic algorithms for average-case problems, especially using spectral methods.</li>
  <li>Analysis of Boolean functions. Especially structural and Fourier properties of concrete models, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form">DNFs</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also have interest in interactions between CS theory and practical problems, especially in understanding experimental results on real instances, and in developing good algorithms guided by theory.</p>

<p>Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me if you have interest in discussing.</p>

<p>I especially like the the following introductory chapters about being a mathematician:</p>

<p>I am one of those international students who are (yes, still in effect) prevented from entering the US (by cancelling student visas) to join academic activities, more specifically, due to the <a href="https://www.nafsa.org/regulatory-information/proclamation-suspending-entry-chinese-students-and-researchers-connected-prc">proclamation 10043</a>. Besides its unclear definition of â€˜military-civil fusion strategy and its misidentification of students I donâ€™t see any valid reasons behind this policy.</p>
