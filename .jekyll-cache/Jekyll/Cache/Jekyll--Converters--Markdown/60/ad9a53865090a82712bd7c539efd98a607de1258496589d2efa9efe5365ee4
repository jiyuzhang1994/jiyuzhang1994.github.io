I"<p>I am a PhD student in the Stat&amp;CS program at Bocconi University. Previously I studied at UCSB and Rutgers University, Iâ€™m grateful to all the professors who taught and helped me there.</p>

<h2 id="academic-interests">Academic Interests</h2>

<p>I like interesting mathematical problems with motivation from computation.</p>

<p>Currently I mainly think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design and analysis of heuristic algorithms for average-case problems.</li>
  <li>Analysis of Boolean functions. Especially structural and Fourier properties of concrete computational models, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form">DNFs</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also have a growing interest in projects that aim at closing the gap between theory and practice, especially in understanding experimental results on real instances, and in developing good heuristics guided by theory.</p>

<p>Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me if you have interest in discussing.</p>

<p>I especially like the the following introductory chapters about being a mathematician:</p>
