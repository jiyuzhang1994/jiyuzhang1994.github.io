I"<p>I’m excited to be moving to Bocconi University to continue my PhD study. Previously I studied at UCSB, Rutgers University. I’m interested in mathematical problems with motivation from Computational Complexity, Foundation of Cryptography, Learning Theory.</p>

<p>Currently I think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Structural and Fourier properties of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form">DNFs</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have interest in discussing.</p>

<p>I especially like the the following introductory chapters about being a mathematician:</p>

<p><a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~saks/300S/Part1.pdf">Thinking and communicating about mathematics</a></p>

<p>I am one of those international students who are banned from entering the US to pursue academic study, more specifically, affected by the <a href="https://www.nafsa.org/regulatory-information/proclamation-suspending-entry-chinese-students-and-researchers-connected-prc">proclamation 10043</a>.</p>
