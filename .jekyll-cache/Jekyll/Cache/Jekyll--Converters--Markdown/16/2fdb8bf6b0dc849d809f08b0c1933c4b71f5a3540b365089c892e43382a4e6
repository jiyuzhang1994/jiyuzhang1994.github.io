I"e<p>Previously I studied at UCSB, Rutgers University. I’m interested in mathematical problems (combinatorics and probability) with motivation from Computational Complexity, Foundation of Cryptography, Learning Theory.</p>

<p>Currently I think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Structural and Fourier properties of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form">DNFs</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have interest in discussing.</p>
