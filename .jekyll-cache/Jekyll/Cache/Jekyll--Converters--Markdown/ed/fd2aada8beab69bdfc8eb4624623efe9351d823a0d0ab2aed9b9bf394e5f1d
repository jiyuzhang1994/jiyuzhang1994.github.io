<h2 id="1one-way-functions">1.One-Way Functions</h2>

<p>Intuitively, a one-way function is a function that is easy to compute but difficulty to invert. Formally,</p>

<p><strong>Definition 1.1 (OWF)</strong> A function <script type="math/tex">f: \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1\}^*</script> is one-way if</p>

<ol>
  <li>For any $x$ that is in the domain of $f$, $f(x)=y$ can be computed in polynomial time.</li>
  <li>For any PPT algorithm $A$ and all suffciently large $n$ ($n&gt;N_c$ for some $N_c$),<br />
<script type="math/tex">\Pr[f(z) = y \mid x \leftarrow \{0,1\}^n,\ f(x) = y,\ z\leftarrow A(y, 1^n)\ ]\leq negl(n)</script><br />
where $negl(n)$ is the negligible function.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Definition 1.2 (negligible function)</strong> A function $negl(\cdot)$ is negligible if $\forall$ $c&gt;0$ $\exists$ $N_c$ such that $\forall$ $n&gt;N_c$, $negl(n)&lt;\frac{1}{n^c}$.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion.</strong> We note that requiring the unary number $1^n$ as adversary’s input is necessary. Consider the function <script type="math/tex">f(x) = \lvert x\rvert</script>. The adversary’s input has length $log(\lvert x \rvert)$, while the output length is exponential in that. There function should be one-way because the adversary doesn’t have enough time to write down the answer. But it is intuitively easy to invert.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion.</strong> The function that satisfies the above definition is called a <strong>uniformly strong one-way</strong> function. We will talk about weak one-way function later. It is <em>uniform</em> because we assume the adversary is a uniform algorithm that can take any input length. If in the second requirement above, we allow the adversary to use different algorithms for different lengths (i.e. it is a non-uniform circuits family), then we say the function is <strong>non-uniform strong one-way</strong>.</p>

<p>We now introduce weak one-way functions. A weak one-way function is a function that is hard to invert with noticeable probability.</p>

<p><strong>Definition 1.3 (weak OWF)</strong> A function is called (uniformly) weak one-way if</p>

<ol>
  <li>For any $x$ that is in the domain of $f$, $f(x)=y$ can be computed in polynomial time.</li>
  <li>$\exists\ c$ such that for any PPT algorithm $A$ and all suffciently large $n$ ($n&gt;N_c$ for some $N_c$) 
<script type="math/tex">\Pr[f(z) = y \mid x \leftarrow \{0,1\}^n,\ f(x) = y,\ z\leftarrow A(y, 1^n)\ ]> \frac{1}{n^c}</script><br />
where $negl(n)$ is the negligible function.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, there is a theorem due to Yao says that any weak one-way function can be transformed into a strong one-way function.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 1.4 (Yao)</strong> There exists a weak one-way function iff there is a strong one-way function.</p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong> will complete later</p>

<h2 id="2-necessary-complexity-assumptions">2. Necessary Complexity Assumptions</h2>

<p>We state necessary complexity assumptions for the existence of one-way functions.</p>

<p>First of all, we should observe that</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 2.1</strong> If $P=NP$, then one-way functions don’t exist.</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong> If $P=NP$, then the adversary can non-deterministically guess all values of $x$ and evaluate f(x).</p>
