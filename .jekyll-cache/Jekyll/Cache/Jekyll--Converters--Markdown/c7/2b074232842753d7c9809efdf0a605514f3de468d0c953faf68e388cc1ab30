I"ñ<p>Iâ€™m a PhD student in the Stat&amp;CS program at Bocconi University. Previously I studied at UCSB and Rutgers University, many thanks to all the professors who taught and helped me there.</p>

<p>I like interesting mathematical problems with motivation from computation.</p>

<p>Currently I mainly think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design and analysis of heuristic algorithms for average-case problems.</li>
  <li>Analysis of Boolean functions. Especially structural and Fourier properties of concrete models, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form">DNFs</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also have a growing interest in interactions between CS theory and practice, especially in understanding experimental results on real instances, and in developing good heuristic algorithms guided by theory.</p>

<p>Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me if you have interest in discussing.</p>

<p>I especially like the the following introductory chapters about being a mathematician:</p>

<p>I am one of those international students who are (yes, still in effect) prevented from entering the US to join academic activities, mainly by revoking visas. More specifically, this is due to the <a href="https://www.nafsa.org/regulatory-information/proclamation-suspending-entry-chinese-students-and-researchers-connected-prc">proclamation 10043</a>. Besides its unclear definition of â€˜military-civil fusion strategy and its misidentification of students in execution. I donâ€™t see any valid reasons behind this policy.</p>
