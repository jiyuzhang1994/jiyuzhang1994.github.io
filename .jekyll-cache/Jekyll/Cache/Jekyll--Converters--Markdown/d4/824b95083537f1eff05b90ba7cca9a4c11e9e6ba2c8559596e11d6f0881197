I"þ<p>After rethinking the purpose of writing notes and their readability, Iâ€™ve decided to make some changes. Here are some observations and ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make certain details omitted. As a principle, the omitted part should either be an easy exercise, or be be found/learnt via online resources. The ability to prove from scratch, or to search for certain clues and reconstruct proofs should be trained.</li>
</ul>

<p>A beginner would write proofs as detailed as possible, for he was unfamiliar with the calculation. Itâ€™s time to omit certain details as the familiarity increases. Also, with different emphases on details, the notes are looking messy and the main clues of the proof arenâ€™t apparent. Cuting certain details helps with readability.</p>
