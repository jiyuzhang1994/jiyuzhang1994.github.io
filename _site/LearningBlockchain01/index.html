      <p>Cryptocurrency relies on special cryptographic hash functions with nice properties. Today I’d like to explain these properties and discuss their applications.  This notes refered to &lt; Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Technologies A Comprehensive Introduction &gt; by Bonneau et al.</p>

<p>A <em>hash function</em> is an efficiently computable function <script type="math/tex">H: \{0,1\}^*\rightarrow \{0,1\}^k</script> where $k$ is a fixed parameter. That is</p>
<ol>
  <li>Its input can be of string of any size.</li>
  <li>Its output is of fixed length, usually set to be 256 bits.</li>
  <li>It is efficiently computable.</li>
</ol>

<p>While to be useful for cryptocurrency, it requires the hash function to be of special <em>cryptographic</em> hash function. Specifically, the following three properties hold: (1) Collision resistant;  (2) Hiding; (3) Puzzlefriendliness.</p>

<p>I’ll explain these properties in detail.</p>

<h2 id="property-1-collision-resistant">Property 1: Collision Resistant</h2>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> <em>(Collision Resistant)</em> A hash function $H$ is said to be <em>Collision Resistant</em> if it is <strong>infeasible to find</strong> two values $x$ and $y$, such that $x\neq y$ yet $H(x) = H(y)$.</p>

<p>The following notes are made:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Collision exists as long as the input set size is larger than the output set size.</li>
  <li>There is a trivial algorithm to find a collision for a (say) 256-bit output: pick $2^{256}+1$ distinctive values, compute the hashes for each of them and check equivalence for each pair. However, this method will take more than octillion years before finding such a pair. And we consider this method <strong>not feasible</strong>.</li>
  <li>No hash functions have been proved to be collision resistant. i.e, there is possibility that there exists efficient (feasible) algorithm to find collisions. The hash functions we rely on in practice are those people have tried very very hard to find a method to break (i.e. find an efficient algorithm to compute collisions).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="application">Application</h3>
<p>The collision resistant property can be used in the following logic: If one knows $x$ and $y$ are different, then it’s safe to say $H(x)$ and $H(y)$ are different. This can be confirmed by a contradictory argument. If one knows/can find/can compute a pair of $x$ and $y$ s.t $x\neq y$ and $H(x) = H(y)$, this violates our assumption that $H$ is collision resistant.</p>

<p>Now one application of this logic is <em>Online File Storage</em>. Suppose you have a very large file and would like to upload it to a online file storage system so that you can download it later, possibly on another computer. How can you be sure that the file you download later is the same as you uploaded. One way is to store the file locally and compare it with the downloaded version bit by bit. Well, this may not be efficient since the file is very large. However, if you only store the hash of the file locally, and compare it with the hash of the file you downloaded, it is much more efficient. And the collision resistant property guarantees that, the system is hard to find a different file and its hash is the same as that of the one you uploaded.</p>

<p>This is like you’re memorizing a specifc sign of your item while no one can find a fake item that has the sign as yours. When you get it back, you just examine this sign and figure out whether it is indeed the item you stored.</p>
