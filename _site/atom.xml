   <title>Public Inefficiency in Italy</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;September 28th 2023&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I went to the police station in Milan to renew my permit of stay. The guard wouldn’t let me in if I just explain to him I missed the last appointment because I was in China with my family. In fact last time, they told me it’s okay if I missed it, I would receive another appointment automatically. Anyway, the trick is that you have to complain to them you could not make an appointment online. That means, if you complain, it works. Otherwise they ask you to “come tomorrow” recursively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I got in, and was able to talk to the police who is in charge of immigrating affairs. After working on the computer for a while, it seemed that he couldn’t handle my case, instead he told me he would give me another date so I could come – the date is three months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 19th 2023&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Chinese it’s already annoying enough to obtain a visa to enter any western country, however when the Italian embassy gets involved, things become exponentially harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italian wants to be decent, everything needs to be formally addressed. One problem: even the office staff don’t understand the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family wants to visit me in the summer. To help my family to get a visa, I need to obtain a certificate of relationship for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem 1: even this certificate is not clearly defined, you cannot find any format of this certificate on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem 2: they do not specify who would authorize the document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went to the Chinese embassy in Milan to obtain a certificate, which was reasonable because all my documents are in Chinese so they can recognize and verify. After weeks of effort, finally my family received the certificate and submitted it to the Italian embassy, and they said: we cannot acknowledge your document (because we don’t trust the Chinese embassy), we need an authorization from the Italian side. “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Va bene, now you ask them: WHERE in Italy should I go to obtain the authorization. They respond: we don’t know, but our boss explicitly required that. Perhaps in comune di Milano or the Prefettura, you know, someone came here last week with that authorized document so it’s not impossible… Here is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem 3: you cannot directly talk to the officer who has the authority to issue your visa, but you can only talk to the one who helps you to communicate. They even create a GAP in your communication, and you cannot ask directly what you need!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem 4: when I went to the comune di Milano and the Prefettura, apparently they don’t know what the Italian embassy staff is talking about…&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Turing-endorsed typewriters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/typewriter.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wondered if the store owner just thinks it’s cool to relate typewriters to Turing machines. However, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; it writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“… Turing had a lifelong interest in machines: “Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; [his mother] Mrs. Turing had a typewriter; and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter ‘mechanical’” (Hodges p. 96). While at Princeton pursuing his PhD, Turing built a Boolean-logic multiplier …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Turing did had some inspiration from typewriters.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Moving to Milan</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finally settled(?) in Milan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(?) (I still haven’t received my permit of stay, and a lot of more things are in process, but in Italy it takes time.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 1st, after one week’s struggling, the local goverment of Chengdu eventually decided a lockdown. The announcement went out at around 12pm requiring that all the communities in the city should forbid people from going in/out, starting at 6pm. Except that each family can have a representative who tested negative, to buy groceries once a day. Despite the suddeness of the announcement, luckily, my flight to Tianjin took off at 4pm. (Of course, with my negative covid-test result valid within 24 hours)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not have time to think about missing my family. With a bit more luck, after one night of anxiety I made it on my flight from Tianjin to Milan, and landed in Malpensa Airport in the local evening - this is the first time I set my foot in the Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people I’ve met so far are nice. On my day of arrival my landlord, who was an elegant lady, had been patiently waiting for my moving in at around midnight. The rooms are furnished with delicated details. Those fashion books on the shelves seem to suggest how a noticeable fraction of people in Milan are enthusiastic about dressing in good styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The faculty and my fellow students are friendly, and quite into going to `aperitivo’ – I’ve drunk too much than I would have in China in the past two weeks, but so far I haven’t turned down those warm invitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fashionbooks.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/womaninbook.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Magazines with thousands of recommended shop addresses in it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coffee here is so affordable, on a vendor machine it is 0.40 euro to have an Espresso. In a store probably a little more but still less than 2 euros (Starbucks? here I rarely heard about it).  Last week I had my first Italian pizza, and it easily outranked all the pizzas I had before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about gelatos? Yesterday my fellow students kindly invited me to have a gelato, my reaction was: sorry, I’m not prepared. I’ll have one when I am in that mood. So let’s save it for a moment.  [update: my fellow student told me later: in Italy, you should always be in that mood!]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start to pick some new habits. The thieves here seem to be active and people will remind you to put your backpack in front when you are taking public tranportation. I am also thinking about having a new wallet to store the coins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mosquitoes are still bothering me as they are in China (I hate mosquitoes as much as they love me), but, fine, since I finally can have some people to talk with in person, about TCS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negative experience? Yes. But let’s save it for next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ciao!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;A chair made of paperboard in my room&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Navigli at dusk&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
