      <p>In this note we mainly discuss common cryptographic primitives: one-way functions (OWF), one-way permutations (OWP) and trapdoor functions (TDP).</p>

<h2 id="1one-way-functions">1.One-Way Functions</h2>

<p>Intuitively, a one-way function is a function that is easy to compute but difficulty to invert. Formally,</p>

<p><strong>Definition 1.1 (OWF)</strong> A function <script type="math/tex">f: \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1\}^*</script> is one-way if</p>

<ol>
  <li>For any $x$ that is in the domain of $f$, $f(x)=y$ can be computed in polynomial time.</li>
  <li>For any PPT algorithm $A$ and all suffciently large $n$ ($n&gt;N_c$ for some $N_c$),<br />
<script type="math/tex">\Pr[f(z) = y \mid x \leftarrow \{0,1\}^n,\ f(x) = y,\ z\leftarrow A(y, 1^n)\ ]\leq negl(n)</script><br />
where $negl(n)$ is the negligible function.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Definition 1.2 (negligible function)</strong> A function $negl(\cdot)$ is negligible if $\forall$ $c&gt;0$ $\exists$ $N_c$ such that $\forall$ $n&gt;N_c$, $negl(n)&lt;\frac{1}{n^c}$.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion.</strong> We note that requiring the unary number $1^n$ as adversary’s input is necessary. Consider the function <script type="math/tex">f(x) = \lvert x\rvert</script>. The adversary’s input has length $log(\lvert x \rvert)$, while the original $x$ has length exponential in that. This function should be one-way because the adversary doesn’t have enough time to write down the answer. But it is intuitively easy to invert.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion.</strong> The function that satisfies the above definition is called a <strong>uniformly strong one-way</strong> function. We will talk about weak one-way function later. It is <em>uniform</em> because we assume the adversary is a uniform algorithm that can take any input length. If in the second requirement above, we allow the adversary to use different algorithms for different lengths (i.e. it is a non-uniform circuits family.), then we say the function is <strong>non-uniform strong one-way</strong>.</p>

<p>We now introduce weak one-way functions. A weak one-way function is a function that is hard to invert with noticeable probability.</p>

<p><strong>Definition 1.3 (weak OWF)</strong> A function is called (uniformly) weak one-way if</p>

<ol>
  <li>For any $x$ that is in the domain of $f$, $f(x)=y$ can be computed in polynomial time.</li>
  <li>$\exists\ c$ such that for any PPT algorithm $A$ and all suffciently large $n$ ($n&gt;N_c$ for some $N_c$) 
<script type="math/tex">\Pr[f(z) = y \mid x \leftarrow \{0,1\}^n,\ f(x) = y,\ z\leftarrow A(y, 1^n)\ ]> \frac{1}{n^c}</script><br />
where $negl(n)$ is the negligible function.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, there is a theorem due to Yao says that any weak one-way function can be transformed into a strong one-way function.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 1.4 (Yao)</strong> There exists a weak one-way function iff there is a strong one-way function.</p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong> will complete later.</p>

<p>We now introduce one-way permutations,  trapdoor permutations.</p>

<p><strong>Definition 1.5 (OWP)</strong> A function is a one-way permutation if</p>
<ol>
  <li>It satisfies all requirements of one-way function.</li>
  <li>It is a permutation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Trapdoor functions are OWPs that, given auxiliary information, can 
<strong>Definition 1.6 (TDP)</strong> A function $f$ is a TDP if</p>
<ol>
  <li>It satisfies all requirements in Definition 1.5</li>
  <li>There is a polynomial-time algorithm $I$, a constant $c$ and a string $t_k$ such that, for all large enough $k$, $t_k$ is of length at most $O(k^c)$, and for any $x\in {0,1}^k$, $I(f(x), t_k) = z$ where $f(z) = f(x)$.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="2-necessary-complexity-assumptions">2. Necessary Complexity Assumptions</h2>

<p>We state necessary complexity assumptions for the existence of one-way functions. These assumptions are useful for us to argue in the form: a protocol $A$ is not secure because it can break our complexity assumptions.</p>

<p>First of all, we should observe that</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 2.1</strong> If $P=NP$, then one-way functions don’t exist.</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong> If $P=NP$, then the adversary can non-deterministically guess all values of $x$ and evaluate f(x) to verify the answer.</p>

<p>Since we assume (in the uniform model) that the adversary is a PPT (i.e. in BPP), we should see that even $BPP = NP$ will imply the non-existence of uniform OWF.</p>

<p>In summary, our two basic assumptios will be: $P\subseteq BPP \not\subseteq NP$.</p>

<p>While we don’t know whether $BPP \neq NP$ or $P/poly \neq NP$ hold, we can show that $BPP \subseteq P/poly$.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 2.2 (Adleman)</strong> $BPP\subseteq P/poly$</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong> For a language $L$ in BPP that can be recognized by a Turing machine $M$, it can be shown that by repeatedly running $M$ many (at most polynomial) times and taking the majority vote, we can reduce the error probability to arbitrary exponentially small value. Let’s assume the error probability on both sides is $2^{-r}$ for some $r&gt;n$, so the number of coin flips used by the new Turing machine $M^\prime$ is at most $r$.<br />
    According to the above, its’ equivalent to say that for any fixed $x$, for a random string of length $r$, the probability that $M^\prime(x, r)$ accepts is at most $2^{-r}$. We use the union bound to bound that, for all possible inputs <script type="math/tex">x\in \{0,1\}^n</script>, the probability that $M^\prime$ rejects at least one of these $x$ is at most $2^{n-r} &lt; 1$. Therefore, for a random string, there is a positive probability (greater than $1-2^{n-r}$) that can make all $x$ be accepted by $M^\prime$. We take the existence of such a string and hardwire it into our circuit. By doing this the circuits family can decide $L$ without any randomness.</p>
